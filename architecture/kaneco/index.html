      <div>
        <h6>McCann & Fitzgerald</h6><p>Brought in by the client for consultation of their ground floor commercial kitchen/canteen and 6th floor commercial kitchen. I created surveyed drawings through my own site dimensions and developed new canteen/kitchen layouts with a Kaneco director. I was responsible for the proposed design of the front-of-house canteen space including hot & cold servery counters, self-serve counters, coffee counter, refreshment station, seating space and associated finishes.  Small interventions were made to the 6th floor support kitchen to improve equipment reliability and staff workflow using AutoCAD while plans and 3D visuals of the new canteen were created using AutoCAD, Sketchup, Vray and Photoshop.</p>

      <div>
        <h6>State Street Bank Canteen</h6><p>Involved in this project to work with the architect on approving bespoke front-of-house designs for the building’s canteen. This involved developing servery counters, pay counters and self-serve counters using Sketchup 3D and V-Ray for initial approval. Fabrication drawings were then developed and later approved via viewpoint for final production. The work involved developing finish details for stone counters, joinery, tile, powder coated panels and stainless-steel panels. Services were incorporated in counter designs including waste, water supply, electrical outlets and required isolator, pole spur switches. Responsible for sourcing and ordering tile finish on-budget and matching architect’s specifications. Worked with stainless steel fabricator for steel frame and metal panel details. On-site duties included site survey for fabrication drawings as well as on-site coordination with stone contractor for final counter-top details.</p>

        <h6>Dublin Airport Consultancy</h6><p>Kaneco was hired to survey and assess the food offers of five Dublin Airport lounges including the proposal of a new lounge. I was placed in charge of carrying out detailed surveys of each lounge kitchen/servery space and working with a Kaneco director to propose improved cooking layouts. This task proved challenging as space in each kitchen lounge was quite limited. There was an element of determining how Mise En Place could be used in each kitchen depending on each offer intended. The proposal of a new lounge also offered the opportunity to build a larger kitchen as a “support” or production kitchen for the other kitchens using packaging and hot hold equipment. Layouts were proposed for each kitchen using AutoCAD with detailed legends of proposed equipment.</p>

      <img class="lazy" src="assets/images/airport.webp" alt="PWC Cafe">
      <div>
        <h6>PWC Cafe & Lounge</h6><p>Created layouts and visuals for the PWC Group located in downtown Dublin. The idea behind the layout is to combine an existing shop and café on the ground floor of the PWC building. The project looked to promote reusable and environmentally friendly materials for this new design. I was tasked with creating 2D layouts and 3D visuals for this design by reusing as many existing materials from the shop and café as possible. Existing counter space, refrigerated retail and shop shelving were all incorporated into one cohesive space with additional new materials. A new palette of white and wood was adopted into the visuals as well as a rebranding of the café name. 2D layout was designed using AutoCAD and 3D Visuals were created using Google Sketchup/Vray.</p>

        <h6>PWC Break Rooms</h6><p>Much of this project was prefabricated to reduce the amount of time required on site. The room partitions were created using glazed and paneled crittall walls and were installed at early stages of construction to also act a hoarding during the interior fit-out. Careful planning was required to meet the tight deadlines requested by the client. I had surveyed and designed the layout of these two break rooms including the furniture, crittall walls, kitchen and services. I was also responsible for creating drawings/visuals for client approval, managing the procurement of finishes, furniture and equipment for this project.</p>

      <div>
        <h6>New Children’s Hospital</h6><p>Kaneco was given the opportunity to provide stainless steel works to the New Children's Hospital project located in Dublin. This Involved developing hygienic details for stainless steel interior fit out works with the design team. I was involved in the extensive surveying of each room requiring these stainless-steel works, working with both BAM engineers as well as the design team to determine works required for each room assigned to us. The developed drawings were then submitted via a file sharing system for formal approval before fabrication.</p>

         <h6>Kaneco Website</h6><p>I was tasked with designing and building the Kaneco website. The website was initially designed using Figma but then transitioned to a combined design/build strategy using Wordpress and Elementor. I was able to use my previous experience in web design to help design and build this site. The site is structured around the Astra Wordpress theme with Elementor to create a custom website layout. Additional plugins used for SEO, Site security and UI features. Take a look at www.kaneco.ie</p>

        <h6>Bujo Burgers Terenure</h6><p>This complete fit-out proved to be a major learning curve for me due to the extent of work required to the building and the various subcontractors involved with the build. New structural steel and a large fire shutter had to be introduced to create an open view into the kitchen with ample space for a hot pass counter. We worked joiners to create a new façade at the entrance while also coordinating the complete re-leveling and tiling of the front-of-house space. We worked with a combination of fire regulations, large commercial ventilation requirements and high spec finish details to complete this project. I was assisting with layouts, service drawings and fabrication details for this project while also contacting various trades to schedule their works on site.</p>

        <h6>Diageo Post Office</h6><p>Kaneco was responsible for supplying both back-of-house and front-of-house commercial kitchen equipment to the builder for this project. This included the counter fabrications in the server and seating area. I was tasked with attending bi-weekly site visits with the project manager. The project also involved liaising with the project architect, builder and mechanical engineer and other subcontractors to finalize services and finishes in coordination with Kaneco’s equipment and fabrications. General arrangement plans, service drawings and fabrication drawings were developed for coordination and production purposes. Inspections and surveys were frequently carried out to ensure errors were avoided.</p>

        <h6>DonnyBrook Manor Hotel Kitchen Proposal</h6><p>This work involved a design proposal as well as a tender presentation for commercial kitchen works for the DonnyBrook Manor Hotel project in Dublin. Kitchen design work was developed with one of the company directors along with 3D Renderings and an interactive PDF presentation showcasing Kaneco’s proposed layouts, equipment specifications and partner companies.</p>

        <h6>Marquette Re-Design</h6><p>This coffee Pod is part of the larger Marquette food offering at Terminal 1 Dublin airport. The Pod was designed, approved and built in a considerably short time frame, especially with strict airport regulations. Detailed fire rating documentation was included with construction drawings submitted to the Dublin Airport Authority. Many of the built elements in this project were intended to be as prefabricated as possible; cutting tools inside the terminal were restricted to maintain airport air quality standards. The prefabricated elements also needed to be constrained to a certain dimension due to the size of the airport’s commercial x-ray devices.</p>

        <h6>No. 22 Stephens Green (Cellar 22 and Floritz)</h6><p>Kaneco was brought in by the client to work with the design team from Project Orange on the stainless-steel elements of the bars for both Cellar 22 (basement) and Floritz Restaurant (Ground floor). I was tasked with creating fabrications and visuals for the bars in coordination with designer and joinery drawings. Detailed site measurements were taken, and final installation was coordinated with the builder. An evaluation of the existing kitchen was also assessed, with changes to some cooking line equipment and replacement of missing/disused equipment.</p>

      <div>
        <h6>The Pantry at Cliff at Lyons</h6><p>This project required extensive design drawings and coordination with the client, joiners and stone masons to complete this project. I was responsible for designing and issuing each bespoke joinery unit to go into the project along with drawing and coordination of the detailed stone counter designs for each countertop. Communication was key with both the client and other trades to properly schedule equipment delivery, joinery installation and stone counter surveying/installation.3D visuals mere made in conjunction with detailed drawings to assist in fabrication.</p>
