            <h6>565 North Service Road (Waterview Condos)</h6><p>Waterview Condominiums consists of two high rise buildings in two phases. I entered the project when Phase 1 was breaking ground and Phase 2 was going through site plan approval for an additional six stories from the original design. SPA was completed by ICON while the construction drawings were given to a drafting company called TechniCAD. I was tasked with minor revisions for resubmission of site plan approval (co-ordinating with building permit drawings from techniCAD, creation of black line drawings for marketing purposes and review of building permit/construction drawings).</p>

            <h6>5451 Lakeshore Road (Parkview)</h6><p>5451 Lakeshore road was a development with seven high-end regular townhouse units. The narrow lot size only permitted an entry/exit lane with one block of townhouses. The townhouses were larger in square footage than a typical townhouse and were specified with higher quality materials. I had taken over the submission of the site plan approval while also creating a set of drawings for building permit submission. Construction details were created by referencing previous construction drawings from ICON and TechniCAD.</p>

            <h6>U.C. Towns Development</h6><p>U.C. Towns is a joint project in Oshawa, Ontario. Canada with ICON Architects and Cassidy and Company. The three phase project consists of multiple blocks of six-eight townhouse units. The buildings were four stories in height which is not permitted in single family homes; a code consultant filed a code report to the city of Oshawa with additional code requirements to ensure the safety of the occupants in the proposed buildings. ICONâ€™s role was to review/stamp the drawings that Cassidy and CO. had created for submission and to perform monthly site visits with final reviews to permit occupancy.</p>

            <h6>219-227 Major Mackenzie Drive East</h6><p>Major Mackenzie was a small development consisting of two blocks: both blocks totaled a number of eleven townhouses. The project was nearing completion of site plan approval when I was tasked to create the working drawings for building permit submission. Creation of detail and wall assemblies required minor changes to layout designs for permit. Cladding research and foundation details in coordination with structure had also altered the exterior look of the buildings. Collaboration with structural and mechanical teams were needed to take the permit drawings to near completion.</p>

            <h6>Toronto of the Future Exhibition</h6><p>The Toronto of the Future exhibition was an exhibition for new and upcoming projects in the Greater Toronto Area. Projects could be displayed in either video, panel design and/or model. The partners at ICON Architects had placed me in charge of coordinating with the exhibition team and creating/printing the panel designs. The panels were six feet in height and four feet in width. The projects chosen for each display were high rise developments at 39-97 Carrville Road and 9218 Yonge Street. Renderings were created using shaded light and then completed on adobe photoshop.</p>
