          <h6>State Street Bank Cafe Design</h6><p>Kaneco was awarded this State Street Bank Project by creating 2D plan and 3D visuals. The layout and visuals were created by Kaneco which incorporated the “53.3 Degrees” coffee color palettes and illustrations. The light wood bamboo & white front counter was created with required equipment including a cold deli counter and coffee station & pay station. Salamander grills are the main piece of equipment on the rear stainless-steel counter. White tile with metal framed bamboo shelving were added to the rear wall in order to create depth in the design.</p>

      <div>
          <h6>PWC Cafe Renovation</h6><p>Created layouts and visuals for the PWC Group located in downtown Dublin. The idea behind the layout is to combine an existing shop and café on the ground floor of the PWC building. The project looked to promote reusable and environmentally friendly materials for this new design. I was tasked with creating 2D layouts and 3D visuals for this design by reusing as many existing materials from the shop and café as possible. Existing counter space, refrigerated retail and shop shelving were all incorporated into one cohesive space with additional new materials. A new palette of white and wood was adopted into the visuals as well as a rebranding of the café name. 2D layout was designed using AutoCAD and 3D Visuals were created using Google Sketchup/Vray.</p>

          <h6>Kaneco Website</h6><p>I was tasked with designing and building the Kaneco website. The website was initially designed using Figma but then transitioned to a combined design/build strategy using Wordpress and Elementor. I was able to use my previous experience in web design to help design and build this site. The site is structured around the Astra Wordpress theme with Elementor to create a custom website layout. Additional plugins used for SEO, Site security and UI features. Take a look at www.kaneco.ie</p>

          <h6>Guinness Brewery Testing Station</h6><p>The Guinness Brewery in Dublin were looking to renovate their “Control Tower” and were asked by Kaneco to create a 2D layout and 3D visuals for their testing station. Specific products were specified for the stainless-steel worktops in order to test the content of a pint of Guinness. As this space was also to be used for providing tours to consultants, a textured stone wall was to be applied with the famous Guiness logo in black. I created the initial layout in AutoCAD which was then transferred to Google SketchUp for 3D visuals using the V-Ray Plugin.</p>

I entered the project when Phase 1 was breaking ground and Phase 2 was going through site plan approval for an additional six stories from the original design. SPA was completed by ICON while the construction drawings were given to a drafting company called TechniCAD. I was tasked with minor revisions for resubmission of site plan approval (co-ordinating with building permit drawings from techniCAD, creation of black line drawings for marketing purposes and review of building permit/construction drawings).</p>

The narrow lot size only permitted an entry/exit lane with one block of townhouses. The townhouses were larger in square footage than a typical townhouse and were specified with higher quality materials. I had taken over the submission of the site plan approval while also creating a set of drawings for building permit submission. Construction details were created by referencing previous construction drawings from ICON and TechniCAD.</p>

The three phase project consists of multiple blocks of six-eight townhouse units. The buildings were four stories in height which is not permitted in single family homes; a code consultant filed a code report to the city of Oshawa with additional code requirements to ensure the safety of the occupants in the proposed buildings. ICON’s role was to review/stamp the drawings that Cassidy and CO. had created for submission and to perform monthly site visits with final reviews to permit occupancy.</p>

The project was nearing completion of site plan approval when I was tasked to create the working drawings for building permit submission. Creation of detail and wall assemblies required minor changes to layout designs for permit. Cladding research and foundation details in coordination with structure had also altered the exterior look of the buildings. Collaboration with structural and mechanical teams were needed to take the permit drawings to near completion.</p>

            <h6><u>THE BORDER</u></h6>
            <p>The project seeks to embody aspects of the fundamental unfinalisability at the heart of human interaction and creation. The basis for exploration is the paradoxical relationship between the self and the other, that we are all “subjects in incompleteness.” This dialogue between self and other has necessary components and useless components. Much like human emotion, understanding can be only to a certain degree: some parts are never understood. An acceptance of these unfinished aspects of human understanding reduces frustration. </p>

            <div class="arch-5">
            <h6><u>INTERVENTIONS</u></h6>
            <p>The project for an archives of unfinished plays, music and dance, connects these themes with the human creative processes. It does not store failed attempts, but lost aspirations. As a sort of  architectural sphinx, the project plays with the disposes of their own potential; it leads them in random directions, changes the exit paths and forces reflection upon those storing the incomplete creative work. It also plays with the lost potential of the creative work, inviting (partial) completion by others, and exposing the result to the elements and the eyes of the world.
            <br><br>
            The concept drawing above focuses boundaries. There is visually more interaction at the boundary. This represents the conflict between self and other; an example could be ones own ideals versus the world's current state or a conflict between two characters. An important aspect of the drawing is that although there is interaction and conflict at the border, the basic essence of self and other is virtually the same.</p>

            <h6><u>ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT: WEAVING</u></h6><br><p>A current issue with immigration in Canada is a lack of immigrants’ integration with current societies, communities and technologies of contemporary Canada. Whether an immigrant decides to move to Canada for cultural integration, a wealthy lifestyle or other reasons, full integration will increase the progress of the individual and the community.</p><br>
            <p>The goal to be achieved is full (while respecting cultures and beliefs) integration into a society. This raised the idea of weaving; weaving two or more strands, fabrics or materials elegantly  into a uniform fabric. The fabric creates a unified entity while maintaining its individual elements; there is a vast amount of connections in a fabric. This is the cause of its appeal and structure.</p>

The type of research project was the choice of the student; my research centre is built for the purpose of developing urban wind turbines due to many issues with large commercial turbines placed around rural areas. Almonte is a small town with a potential to grow. This mirrors the current state of urban designed renewable energy.</p><br>
            <p>Issues associated with commercial wind turbines include gears in the generators malfunctioning, birds being killed by turning blades, disturbance of people and animals (from noise and shadow movement) and falling ice debris during winter season. Due to these issues, the constant goal of this proposed research building is to maximize efficiency and reduce disturbance issues of urban wind turbines which would reduce the demand of commercial turbines.</p>

              <h6><u>TEAM PROJECT</u></h6><p>The project exists because the need for a furniture renovation has occurred in the Carleton School of Architecture; the drafting tables and lockers are old and tools used in visual representation are quickly changing. Students from other architecture schools enter the building and ask why everything is so rough, dirty and not focused towards CAD. Professors have given students the opportunity to give themselves the things they want in a studio by telling them to build their own desks.
              <br><br>
              The desk design shown focuses on two things: the ability to expand and compress when needed and the inclusion of re-purposed material. The versatility of the desk promoted a communal type of studio while effectively creating more available space. </p>

Thorough discussion was involved before the team could decide on what issues to address in the existing studio space. Once the team had decided on important flaws within the studio space, there was discussion on how to design a solution. The team tried to progress the design by first individually sketching ideas and then meet to discuss these sketches. Sketches were shared, approved and dissaproved. Substantial progress of the design occurred when team members focused their attention on a specific and simplified issue to be resolved.

              <h6><u>ARTIST VS. INSTITUTION</u></h6><p>This sound installation was a study based on the sound-scapes of the National arts centre in Ottawa. Various sound samples were developed such as pipe noises, footsteps, intermission conversation and vehicle engines. These sound samples were categorized and placed on a website for viewing. Construction of the installation involved two sides of insulated speakers and the creation of a converging pathway. Black cloth was placed over a framework to create two uniform black boxes or “speakers”. The sound samples were then placed into two opposing characters: the artist and the institution.</p>
